  **Reservations**


  Toy Poodles are in high demand, so we require a 50% deposit to reserve a puppy. The remaining balance is due at the time of pickup. We do not offer refunds or exchanges, so please be sure to do your research before making a reservation.


  **Purchase**


  The purchase price of a Toy Poodle puppy includes the puppy, registration papers, and a one-year health guarantee. We also offer a variety of optional services, such as microchipping, deworming, and vaccinations.


  **Pickup**


  Puppies are available for pickup at our facility once they are 8 weeks old. We require that all puppies be picked up in person. We do not ship puppies.


  **Other**


  - We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.

  - We are not responsible for any accidents or injuries that occur while the puppy is in your care.

  - We are not responsible for any changes in the puppy's health after it has been picked up.

  - Puppies must be at least 8 weeks old before they can be adopted.

  - Puppies must be up-to-date on their vaccinations before they can be adopted.

  - Puppies must be spayed or neutered before they can be adopted.

  - We have a strict no-return policy for puppies.
